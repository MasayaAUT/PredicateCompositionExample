PredicateCompositionExample

This Unity project demonstrates a Predicate Composition System for building clean, reusable decision logic without long nested if statements.

It is based on a tutorial from the Git-Amend YouTube channel, adapted here as a teaching example.

Predicates are small, single-purpose checks (e.g., IsAlive, InRange, LineOfSight). By combining them with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), we can compose more complex rules.
